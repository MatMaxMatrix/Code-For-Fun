# Image Analysis ChatBot - Fixed Version

This is a fixed version of the Image Analysis ChatBot application that properly handles tkinter and tkinterdnd2 issues.

## Issue Identified

The original application was encountering an error with tkinterdnd2:

```
_tkinter.TclError: invalid command name "tkdnd::drop_target"
```

This error occurs when the tkinterdnd2 Python package is installed, but the underlying Tcl/Tk extension (tkdnd) is not properly installed or configured.

## Fixed Files

1. `fixed_image_analysis_chatbot.py` - A fixed version of the original application that properly checks for tkdnd availability and gracefully falls back to non-drag-and-drop mode if it's not available.

2. `fixed_app.py` - A simplified version of the application that doesn't use tkinterdnd2 at all.

3. `test_tkinter.py` - A simple test script to verify that tkinter is working correctly.

## How to Run

To run the fixed version of the application:

```bash
conda activate new_env
python fixed_image_analysis_chatbot.py
```

## Installing tkdnd (Optional)

If you want to enable drag-and-drop functionality, you need to install the tkdnd Tcl/Tk extension:

### macOS

```bash
brew install tkdnd
```

Then, you need to make sure the tkdnd package is in the Tcl/Tk package path. You can do this by setting the TCLLIBPATH environment variable:

```bash
export TCLLIBPATH="/opt/homebrew/lib"
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install tkdnd
```

### Windows

Download the tkdnd package from https://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdnd/ and follow the installation instructions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the application, try running the `test_tkinter.py` script to verify that tkinter is working correctly:

```bash
python test_tkinter.py
```

If the test script works but the main application doesn't, there might be an issue with the application code. Try running the simplified version:

```bash
python fixed_app.py
```
