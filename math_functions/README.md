# Mathematical Functions

This directory contains various mathematical functions and their implementations.

## Files:

- **happy_palindrome.py**: Functions to check if numbers are happy numbers, palindromes, or both. Includes implementations in both English and Italian.
- **pyramid.py**: Implementation of a dynamic programming solution for finding the maximum path sum in a triangle.
- **complex_line.py**: Function to generate complex number lines with specified radius and angle.
- **linear_estimation.py**: Implementation of linear regression estimation with validation and unit tests.

These files demonstrate various mathematical concepts and their implementations in Python, along with appropriate test cases to verify their correctness.
